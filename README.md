### Kitkat Bot

#### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS v14+](https://nodejs.org)

#### Testing Locally

- You'll need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the contents provided [here](https://github.com/butter-cookie-kitkat/developer-guide/blob/master/kitkat-bot/.env)

- After that it's a simple as running `npm start`!

#### Adding Sound Effects

> Caveats:
> - Only supports MP3s at this time.

- Find a sound effect you'd like to add.
- Upload it to the `effects` folder.
